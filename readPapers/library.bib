abstract = {This paper considers a design problem for time synchronized coverage control of cooperative mobile robots. The derived algorithm provides a coverage control which not only considers the mobility characteristic of each mobile robot for task allocation but generates robot velocity profile for synchronized coverage completion within the constrained time. Since the environment for robot coverage work is modeled as a set of locations to visit by robots, the derived coverage algorithm and its control method are equally well suited to an unstructured working environment as to the structured work space. In determining the number of locations for each robot to visit during coverage operation, a time index derived from the minimum time velocity profile is used for the comparison of robot performance. Once the set of locations has been determined for each robot, the corresponding path tree and velocity profile are generated for synchronized execution of coverage work. The completeness of synchronized group coverage within the constrained time is proven through simulation for a group of mobile robots with different motor characteristics. An additional consideration by the derived coverage controller is collision avoidance of mobile robots in a crowded environment with the aid of finite potential function approach. {\textcopyright} 2014 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems (ICROS).},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel path planning method for cleaning task using multiple robots in large environment. To do so, we suggested algorithm which partitions a given region into several smaller regions and plans the covering path which can completely cover these divided areas. The algorithm also allocates the planed areas to cleaning robots sequentially and generates the paths which robots can take, when moving from an area to another area, in the shortest time. For partitioning the given region into several small areas, the Virtual Door Algorithm is used, and for planning the paths, the template-based approach is used. Previously generated look-up table, which uses the Dijkstra algorithm, is used for determining the path from one are to another. The Task Area Allocation Algorithm, which allocates the divided areas to cleaning robots using look-up table, is used for planning paths that cover the area completely. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our algorithms which can completely cover the given region regardless of the number of cleaning robots and verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through computer simulations.},

Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP) is an approach to model multi-agent decision making problems under uncertainty. There is no efficient exact algorithm to solve these problems since the worst case complexity of the general case has been shown to be NEXP-complete. This paper demonstrates the application of our proposed approximate solution algorithm, which uses evolution strategies, to various DEC-POMDP problems. We show that high level policies can be learned using simplified simulated environments which can readily be transferred to real robots despite having different observation and transition models in the training and the application domains.},

Each robot obtains a payoff (or incurs a cost) for each task and the overall objective for task allocation is to maximize (minimize) the total payoff (cost) of the robots. In general, existing algorithms for task allocation either assume that tasks are independent or do not provide performance guarantee for the situation, in which task constraints exist. We present a distributed algorithm to provide an almost optimal solution for our problem. The key aspect of our distributed algorithm is that the overall objective is (almost) maximized by each robot maximizing its own objective iteratively (using a modified payoff function based on an auxiliary variable, called price of a task). Our distributed algorithm is polynomial in the number of tasks, as well as the number of robots.},

abstract = {The shape, size, and content of MC carbides in a unidirectional Ni-base superalloy have been studied at different solidification rates using material of normal commercial composition (5 ppm nitrogen) and two melts with additions to produce 22 and 30 ppm nitrogen. M(C,N) was found in nitrogendoped specimens. The increased nitrogen content results in a change in carbide morphology from acicular or Chinese-script type to a blocky one. Carbide size increases from 6.85 to 7.25 $\mu$m at 2.5 $\mu$m/s and from 2.31 to 2.81 $\mu$m at 200 $\mu$m/s as the nitrogen content increases from 5 to 22 ppm; carbide size is reduced to 5.2 $\mu$m at 2.5 $\mu$/s and to 2.1 $\mu$m at 200 $\mu$m/s when nitrogen content is further raised to 30 ppm. There is no evident change in carbide content (area percentage) with increase of nitrogen. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis revealed characteristic centers in some of the blocky carbides of TiN, as nuclei of MC or M(C,N) formed in the melt. The influences of nitrogen on carbide at the low solidification rate are stronger than those at the higher rate. With the increase of solidification rate, the carbide turns from bar to Chinese-script type, except for the base alloy at 2.5 $\mu$m/s, and the content and size decrease.},

abstract = {In the multi-robot exploration task of an unknown environment, human operators often need to control the robots remotely and obtain the sensed information by real-time bandwidth-consuming multimedia streams. The task has military and civilian applications, such as reconnaissance, search and rescue missions in earthquake, radioactive, and other dangerous or hostile regions. Due to the nature of such applications, infrastructure networks or pre-deployed relays are often not available to support the stream transmission. To address this issue, we present a novel exploration scheme called Bandwidth-aware Exploration with a Steiner Traveler (BEST). BEST has a heterogeneous robot team with a fixed number of frontier nodes (FNs) to sense the area iteratively. In addition, a relay-deployment node (RDN) tracks the FNs movement and places relays when necessary to support the video/audio streams aggregation to the base station. Therefore, the main problem is to find a minimum path for the relay-deployment robot to travel and the positions to deploy necessary relays to support the stream aggregation in each movement iteration. This problem inherits characteristics of both the Steiner minimum tree and traveling salesman problems. We model the novel problem as the minimum velocity Flow constrained Steiner Traveler problem (FST). Extensive simulations show BEST improves exploration efficiency by 62{\%} on average compared to the state-of-the-art homogeneous robot exploration strategies. BEST also saves cost by using only half the number of robots compared to the counterpart, while still achieving a 24{\%} exploration time reduction.},

Building on the basic MCL algorithm, this article develops a more robust algorithm called Mixture-MCL, which integrates two complimentary ways of generating samples in the estimation. To apply this algorithm to mobile robots equipped with range finders, a kernel density tree is learned that permits fast sampling.

A bondsman posts tasks for agents to complete, along with bounties to be collected by an agent on completion. Multiple agents, taking the role of the bounty hunters, compete to finish tasks and collect their bounties. While a task remains uncompleted, its bounty gradually rises, making it more and more desirable to pursue. Unlike auctions, this model does not assume rationality in agents' bids (as there are none), and since tasks are not exclusive to given agents, the system is robust to highly noisy environments. We examine how agents may locally develop rational task valuations in such an environment, gradually adapting to dividing tasks according to the agents best suited to them. We compare different methods for building these valuations against approaches which are more "auction-like" in that they permit exclusivity, and we do so under both static environments and ones in which agents, and task details, change dynamically.},

@article{Madhavan2002,
abstract = {An extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based algorithm for the localization of a team of robots is described in this paper. The distributed EKF localization scheme is straightforward in that the individual robots maintain a pose estimate using EKFs that are local to every robot. We then show how these results can be extended to perform heterogeneous cooperative localization in the absence or degradation of absolute sensors aboard the team members. The proposed algorithms are implemented using field data obtained from a team of ATRV-mini robots traversing on uneven outdoor terrain.},

abstract = {This work deals with the development of a dynamic task assignment strategy for heterogeneous multi‐robot teams in typical real world scenarios. The strategy must be efficiently scalable to support problems of increasing complexity with minimum designer intervention. To this end, we have selected a very simple auction‐based strategy, which has been implemented and analysed in a multi‐robot cleaning problem that requires strong coordination and dynamic complex subtask organization. We will show that the selection of a simple auction strategy provides a linear computational cost increase with the number of robots that make up the team and allows the solving of highly complex assignment problems in dynamic conditions by means of a hierarchical sub‐auction policy. To coordinate and control the team, a layered behaviour‐based architecture has been applied that allows the reusing of the auction‐based strategy to achieve different coordination levels.},

@article{Wurm2008,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of exploring an unknown environment with a team of mobile robots. The key issue in coordinated multi-robot exploration is how to assign target locations to the individual robots such that the overall mission time is minimized. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to distribute the robots over the environment that takes into account the structure of the environment. To achieve this, it partitions the space into segments, for example, corresponding to individual rooms. Instead of only considering frontiers between unknown and explored areas as target locations, we send the robots to the individual segments with the task to explore the corresponding area. Our approach has been implemented and tested in simulation as well as in real world experiments. The experiments demonstrate that the overall exploration time can be significantly reduced by considering our segmentation method.},

@article{Burgard2005,
abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of exploring an unknown environment with a team of robots. As in single-robot exploration the goal is to minimize the overall exploration time. The key problem to be solved in the context of multiple robots is to choose appropriate target points for the individual robots so that they simultaneously explore different regions of the environment. We present an approach for the coordination of multiple robots, which simultaneously takes into account the cost of reaching a target point and its utility. Whenever a target point is assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored area visible from this target position is reduced. In this way, different target locations are assigned to the individual robots. We furthermore describe how our algorithm can be extended to situations in which the communication range of the robots is limited. Our technique has been implemented and tested extensively in real-world experiments and simulation runs. The results demonstrate that our technique effectively distributes the robots over the environment and allows them to quickly accomplish their mission.},
